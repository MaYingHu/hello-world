My hello-world repository

My name is Ed Morrow. I am from the UK but I live in New England with my wife and two children. Prior to moving to the US, I lived and worked in China for four and a half years: my Chinese name (and Github handle) is 馬鷹虎 (Ma YingHu). I am currently working towards a BS in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). I also work for SNHU as a finance counsellor.
